# Lesson 7: Lists and Arrays

This lesson introduces lists and arrays, focusing on their operations and applications in Python. By completing the exercises, you'll gain proficiency in working with both Python's built-in lists and NumPy arrays.

## Objectives:
- Perform basic and advanced list operations.
- Work with multidimensional lists.
- Use NumPy arrays for numerical operations.
- Debug and resolve issues with lists and arrays.

## TODOs:
1. Work with basic list operations like indexing.
2. Modify lists by adding and removing elements.
3. Use slicing to extract parts of a list.
4. Iterate through lists using loops.
5. Create new lists using list comprehensions.
6. Work with multidimensional lists.
7. Perform basic array operations with NumPy.
8. Apply element-wise operations on arrays.
9. Sort and search lists.
10. Debug and fix list/array operations with issues.

## How to Complete the Lesson:
1. Open `lesson_07.py` and complete the TODOs.
2. Run the script to test your implementation.

## How to Test Your Code:
Run the test script to verify your solutions:

```bash
